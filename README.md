# Hi, I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for JavaScript, the Web, and creating intuitive developer tools and libraries.
From playing trumpet to TypeScript, I've always been drawn to both technical precision and creative expression. I strive to build abstractions that make the complex feel straightforward and natural.
When the code editor is closed, you'll find me perfecting recipes, exploring city streets, or learning new technologies.
